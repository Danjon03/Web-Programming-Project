Here are all of the instructions to start the website

I had to do some wacky things. These are all of the code files. You need to install all the packages and dependancies yourself

HAPI:

Create a folder Project
Inside that folder create a folder Hapi Server

run the command: npm init
run the command: npm install @hapi/hapi

take the server.js file and put it inside that directory. 

run: npm install mongodb


REACT:
Inside project folder create a folder REACT
Inside that folder, open the terminal and run the command: npx create-react-app webProject
run: npm install react-router-dom

Delete all files inside the src folder and replace them with the ones in the github. Everything should work properly.

If it doesn't work, let me know.





There are two parts to start the website. The Hapi API Server, and the React web server.

1. First open the HapiServer Folder. 
2. Open the terminal from that directory
3. run node server.js

This should start the api server on localhost:3000. It is mandatory that the api server starts on port 3000

4. Next go to the React Folder
5. Open the terminal from that directory
6. run npm start

It will ask if it is okay to start on a different port. This is fine. Just type y.
It should open a browser and you can see the home page.

Some errors you might encounter:
It may say mongo is not found. This means that mongodb is not installed on your computer try reinstalling.
